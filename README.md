# Professional_Portfolio
I'm currently a level two business intelligence analyst with Select Medical where I usilize my SQL skillset using multiple variations of the SQL language including, Oracle PL/SQL, IBM DB2 SQL, MSSQL, Postgres SQL and MySQL to build and adjust ETL mappings within Oracle Data Integrator, helping our multiple therapists give exceptional care to patients around the US.

Outside of work I have two amazing puppies, Ragnar and Floki, their names come from the Netflix show "Vikings". You can usually find me on my computer researching new technologies and languages that I'm interested in, building test database systems to build on my skills. Most recently I've begun my python journey, and I'm so excited to see what I'm able to do after. 

Aside from SQL, I also have experience writing PowerShell, VBA, and complex Excel formulas. My favorite platform to use for SQL and reporting is Toad Data Point but I also have experience using CrystalReports, SSRS, Microstrategy, and Prophix.

I appreciate any and all questions, I'm always willing to help a fellow developer build on their skills as well so please reach out if you have any questions or need assistance.
